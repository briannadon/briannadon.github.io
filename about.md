I'm Brian Nadon, a bioinformatics scientist and part-time audio and music production enthusiast. This site will mainly be for collecting my various thoughts on things I think are worth expounding upon (which may or may not match the interests I just shared), and to serve as a mini CV for myself.

My github profiles are here: [personal](https://github.com/briannadon) and [from my time at bitscopic.](https://github.com/bnadon-bitscopic)
